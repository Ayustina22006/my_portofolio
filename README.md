# my_portofolio

**Deskription :**
This portfolio contains a collection of projects that I have worked on while studying Information Technology. My main focus is application development, programming, and technology exploration such as Android Development, Web Development, Data Science, and Cloud Computing. I believe that hands-on practice through projects is the best way to learn and grow as a future software engineer.
